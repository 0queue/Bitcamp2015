# Bitcamp2015
Thomas Harris and Jake Sandler

Code from Bitcamp 2015

## What it does now
- Service.sh starts the server, waits to receive a file
- when it does, it runs it through tester (looks for doritos by default...)
- reports which shelf may or may not have doritos on them

## Improvements one could make
- Train Metamind with A LOT more data
- Train Metamind with EVEN MORE data
- less hardcoded values
- more flexible server
- further subdivision of shelves
- ad infinitum...
